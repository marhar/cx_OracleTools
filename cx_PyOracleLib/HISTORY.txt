Changes from 2.3 to 2.4
 1) In cx_ExportData and cx_ImportData, use cx_Logging to output messages
    rather than write directly to stderr.
 2) In cx_ImportData, added phrase "(n% of file)" to the reporting message when
    possible as requested by Don Reid.
 3) In cx_ImportData, replaced use of executemanyprepared() with executemany()
    and bind arrays instead of dictionaries which actually improves performance
    by about 20-25% in some cases.
 4) In cx_OracleDebugger, fixed case of message attribute.
 5) In cx_OracleObject, added support for describing comments on tables and
    columns.
 6) In cx_OracleObject, eliminate identical grants from the output.
 7) In cx_OracleObject, export the roles before the users as the reason the
    roles are included is because they are administered by the users and the
    grants will by definition fail.
 8) In cx_OracleObject, create the directory before any exporting actually
    takes place in order to handle the situation when no objects end up being
    exported, as requested by Micah Friesen.
 9) In cx_OracleParser, added support for a select for update statement
    without a where clause.
10) In cx_OracleUtils, ignore invalid objects of type "UNDEFINED" which will
    fail to compile anyway.
11) In cx_SQL, added support for compiling comment statements.
12) In cx_SQL, added additional case statement to handle the modify constraint
    clause.
13) cx_Oracle 4.2 is now required.
14) Added new module cx_OracleEx which supports logging of Oracle statements
    and has a few additional convenient methods.
15) Removed module cx_DumpData which was only used by DumpData in the
    cx_OracleTools project.

Changes from 2.2 to 2.3
 1) Added new module cx_OracleDebugger which allows for logging of messages
    using dbms_pipe which was originally exclusively done in DbDebugger, a
    part of the cx_OracleTools package.
 2) Added support for limiting the number of rows exported and skipping a
    certain number of rows first in cx_ExportData.
 3) Removed special code in cx_ExportData and cx_ImportData for handling
    dates since they can be pickled directly now.
 4) Added support for exporting timestamp columns in cx_ExportData.
 5) Improved Oracle SQL and PL/SQL parser in cx_OracleParser.
 6) Added ability to enable roles when connecting to a database using the
    utility function in cx_OracleUtils.
 7) Added support for describing index organized tables in cx_OracleObject.
 8) Added support for describing compressed keys in indexes in cx_OracleObject.
 9) Added support for describing users and roles in cx_OracleObject.
10) Added support for describing trigters which call stored procedures instead
    of executing PL/SQL blocks in cx_OracleObject.
11) Fixed bug in display of size of unicode columns in cx_OracleObject.
12) Fixed bug in display of integer columns in cx_OracleObject.
13) Fixed bug in cx_OracleObject which was not describing generated primary
    key and unique constraints.
14) Ensured that the "&" character is not dumped directly in cx_DumpData so
    that the "set define off" command is not required before running the
    generated script through SQL*Plus.
15) Fixed messages that were generated by cx_SQL when constraints were enabled
    or disabled.
16) Fixed some spelling mistakes.

Changes from 2.1 to 2.2
 1) Added partial support for describing partitioned tables.
 2) Added support for describing constraints directly.
 3) Added utility function which will prompt for a password when one is
    missing in a connect string and then return the modified connect string.
 4) Added support for case sensitivity when describing objects.
 5) Improved the grammar for parsing Oracle code.
 6) Added support for exporting CLOB and BLOB columns directly.
 7) Do not use the column "table_owner" on dba_synonyms if the value is null.
    This is a rather rare situation but raises an exception which discovered.
 8) Add checking for circular dependencies to avoid infinite loops.

Changes for 2.1
 1) First introduced to the public.
